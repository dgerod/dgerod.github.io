# My Test-Driven Development (TDD) experience

Yesterday I talked about [Test-Driven Development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development) in the 'LabRob√≤tica Talks' at the [IRI](http://www.iri.upc.edu).

In this talk I focused on my experience with this technique, and how/when we are applying it in the company I work. You could find the slides I used [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0ByovaZlEMcTJS1M1WjRkQm5zcXc/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-FEo5F7Uh4jOxy25RownYZQ).
