# Talking about 'Robotics Flexible Machines' in ISOLA 2014

I was invited to do a talk about 'Flexible Robotics Machines' in the Industrial Day of the [ISOLA 2104](http://cs.uni-potsdam.de/isola/isola2014) conference.

The content of my presentation was:

- Flexible machines: Robotics & Vision
- Path recognition with on-fly robot synchronization
- How the system works
  - Vision process
  - Robotics process
- Easy programming

Ideas of the presentation are: (1) robots represent a ready-to-use solution with large degrees of freedom that allow to simplify the mechanical problems so that the product handling becomes easier and more suitable with the increasing amount of different formats, and (2) vision systems can detect the products and thanks to advanced shape recognition algorithms the teaching of new format get easier.

Therefore, letâ€™s use these technologies to increase the flexibility of the new machines.

Below you could see a video done during PPMA Show 2015, in this video the ideas and technology I was presented in ISOLA conference were shown.

And the conclusions of the talk were:

- Flexible machines will become more and more important.
- Robots and vision systems are technologies that allow to do flexible machines.
- Easy programming is important for machine builders.
- Machine builders require specific libraries, wizards and tools based on family of machines.
